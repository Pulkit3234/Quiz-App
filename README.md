## About/Description 
This app is a quiz app in which the user can select the type of quiz that he wants from the quiz setup page, then inside the quiz the navigation is very easy with next and previous questions button, and in the end the result score along with the no of correct/incorrect questions are shown using the beautiful pie chart which is dynamically generated with the help of Chart.js javascript library. Users have the option to take the quiz again from the results page.

## Outcomes/Learning
I learnt the use of material UI which is a latest react styling library. Then I learnt about the routing(react-router v5) in react, redux state management to manage the state and also I learnt how to display the data graphically with the help of Chart.js javascript library(in this project pie chart is used for showing results).

## NPM Commands
